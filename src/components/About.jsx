            Hi, my name is Brian Legal and I am a Full Stack Developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I think of myself as a passionate developer who is constantly learning, loves challenging projects, and is always looking for opportunities to expand their skills and knowledge. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, as I am truly fascinated by them. I can say for sure that I am ready to learn and grow as a developer, as well as to face any challenge that lies ahead.
